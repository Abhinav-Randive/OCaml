# My OCaml Learning Journey

Welcome to my OCaml learning repository! This is a personal collection of notes, exercises, and projects I am working on as I explore the OCaml programming language. The purpose of this repository is to document my progress and understanding of OCaml, its unique features, and to track the concepts I’ve learned along the way.

## Why OCaml?
I chose to learn OCaml because:

Functional programming: I’m interested in learning functional programming to improve my problem-solving approach.
Type safety: OCaml's type system helps in writing robust and efficient code, which interests me for long-term software reliability.
Practical applications: OCaml has practical uses in compilers, theorem proving, and financial systems, which align with my interests in programming and software design.

## Learning Goals

My main goals in learning OCaml are:

Gain a deep understanding of functional programming concepts such as immutability, higher-order functions, and recursion.
Master pattern matching, which is one of OCaml’s standout features.
Explore OCaml’s type system, including polymorphic types, algebraic data types (ADTs), and type inference.
Work on several projects to build real-world skills and gain hands-on experience.
Understand the standard library and tools for building, testing, and deploying OCaml programs.
Key Concepts Learned
Here are some of the key OCaml concepts I’ve learned so far:

### Functional Programming

OCaml emphasizes functional programming with first-class functions, immutability, and recursion.
Pattern Matching

One of OCaml’s core features that makes handling data types easier and more expressive.
Algebraic Data Types (ADTs)

Defines types using type declarations. I’ve learned to use variant types (sum types) and record types (product types).
Recursion

Recursion is heavily used in OCaml, replacing many loops. I’ve implemented recursive functions to solve various problems.
Higher-Order Functions

Functions that can take other functions as arguments or return them as results.
Type System

OCaml has a powerful, static type system with type inference. I’ve been exploring how OCaml infers types and the advantages of this feature for writing safe and efficient code.
Error Handling with option and result types

Learn how OCaml uses option for handling values that might be absent and result for handling errors.
